Investing does not always yield a positive return which all investments have risk involved. Do your own research (DYOR) is very important in investing. Following people’s advice may help but fear of missing out also plays a factor. 

Investing is the most intricate aspect of personal finance, and it is also one of the areas where people seek expert help the most. The risk and reward of various assets are vastly varied, and most individuals seek assistance in this part of their financial strategy (Personal finance, 2022).

Saving is vital especially for emergencies. Emergency fund is vital in case any accident or job lay off may occur. As people say cash is king it is important to also have liquid assets in case an investment or a business idea comes to mind.

For effective personal money management, appropriate spending habits are essential.
